# ASM Hell

Dungeon adventure and writing assembler in DOS are incompatible you say? No, they’re not. And also you need a lesson in assembly. Luckily for you, there’s a game that perfectly suits your needs.

Start the first level by command START 0.

Side note 1: Yes, I know this is the game that nobody asked for, but trust me, I suffered more when I had to write it than you will when you’ll have to solve something using assembler.

Side note 2: Normally, this would be considered cheating, but hey, I know some puzzles are not easy and that I flunked the tutorial part. [Here are solutions](https://vilda.net/?p=asmhell) to all 13 layers.

Side note 3: To get excited, you can watch [a boring gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb7lvA1Z4v0) of the 9th layer (solution spoiler): 

Tools: Phaser as framework, GIMP for sprites, “music” by fiddling with WolframTones.

A game made for [LD41](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/asm-hell).
